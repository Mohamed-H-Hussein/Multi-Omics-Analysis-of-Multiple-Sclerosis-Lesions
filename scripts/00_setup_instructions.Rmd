## Setup Instructions

This section explains how to install the required R and Bioconductor packages.

Important Notes:

- The code is commented out so it doesnâ€™t run automatically.
- To install the packages, remove the # and run each line manually.
- If a package is already installed, R will skip reinstalling it.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install BiocManager if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

# Set Bioconductor repositories
options(repos = BiocManager::repositories())

# Install required packages once
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "genefilter", "dplyr", "GeneNet", "ggfortify", "factoextra", "DescTools"))
# BiocManager::install(c("DESeq2", "org.Hs.eg.db", "minfi", "IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19","edgeR", "multtest","clusterProfiler", "vsn"))
